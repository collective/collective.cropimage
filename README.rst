collective.cropimage
====================

This package provides image cropping for images which reside in ATContentTypes fields in Plone.
Those images can be cropped without losing the original images and without adding new images to blobs.
It only sets the cropping dimension to the object annotations.

Currently tested With

* Plone-4.3 and Python-2.7.x
* Image and News Item Content Types.
* collective.contentleadimage
